# The Final Flicker

A candlelit card game of survival and betrayal. You and your neighbours sit in a ritual circle, each guarding a Candle—your deck of cards and your life. Every turn you must Burn cards to feed the Ghosts haunting your Shadow, then take one action: Haunt a neighbour, Banish a ghost, Cast a spell, or risk a desperate Panic. Empty your Candle and you’re Consumed; let three Ghosts of the same suit possess you and you’re lost. Choose a cursed class, play your neighbours, and be the last light burning.
