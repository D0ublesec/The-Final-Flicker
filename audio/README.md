# Bundled audio

Place your **copyright-free** sound files here. They are used by the game when served from this folder (e.g. via `npx serve .` or GitHub Pages).

## SFX filenames (optional)

If present, these replace the built-in synth tones. Use **MP3** or **OGG**; short clips (e.g. 0.1–0.5 s) work best for SFX.
